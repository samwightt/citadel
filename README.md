# Citadel

Citadel is a web app that allows Mastodon admins to more easily moderate their instance. It is built with React and TypeScript, and uses Vite for the build system.

You can try it out here: [https://citadel.samw.dev](https://citadel.samw.dev).

Right now, Citadel allows admins to view users on their servers, report users as spam, and limit domains for federation.

## Development

To get started, clone the repository and run `pnpm install` to install dependencies. Then, run `pnpm dev` to start the development server.
